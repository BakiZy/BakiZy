My name is Milos Petrov, 34 year old junior  Web Developer.
I used to study computer science but i dropped out after struggling with real life issues. Didn't have much connections with coding since then, until spring last year I decided to get back into it.
Started slowly with HTML and CSS, finished couple online courses, and a bootcamp for beginners (worked in Java), after which i also succesfully completed backend bootcamp, 
focusing on .NET technologies. 

You can check my 1st serious project here => https://poodlesvonapalusso.xyz/ 
It's a crud app, with custom JWT authentication and roles, to help me around handling and showing my poodles, as an owner of a small poodle kennel. 
Backend side is done in c#, while the front end site is done with Typescript and React.
