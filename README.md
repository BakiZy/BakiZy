My name is Milos Petrov, 34 year old junior  Web Developer.
I used to study computer science but i dropped out after struggling with real life issues. Didn't have much connections with coding since then, until spring last year I decided to get back into it.
Started slowly with HTML and CSS, finished couple online courses, and a bootcamp for beginners (worked in Java), after which i also succesfully completed backend bootcamp, 
focusing on .NET technologies. 

Now i am working in react, but still prefer working on backend
